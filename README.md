# Monzo-Guess-the-Word QA analysis

I have reviewed the programme that I have created and whilst it works and functions as it should, there could be some improvements. 

If I were to create a second version of the game, I would ensure that when a numerical value is entered into the programme by the user, the output will specify that we can only use letters rather than "Invalid input. Please only enter one letter at a time."

I would ensure the program printed "Invalid input. Please only use letters A-Z."
